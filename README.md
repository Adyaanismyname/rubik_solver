# Rubik's cube solver
A **3x3** rubik's cube solver made with **python**.

---

The first two layers are solved using a home made algorithm (cf. Solving process), the last face is solved using the CFOP method. <br> <br> It doesn't use any external libraries to solve the cube, all the logic is implemented using **pure python**.

## <span style="color: cornflowerblue"> üìí GUI Usage

</div>

### Give the layout of your cube
1. Click on a selector at the bottom left of the screen.
2. Click wherever you want to set the colour.
### Solve your cube
1. Press the solve button
2. The instructions will appear on the console according to the <a href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/8i7FQ.jpg>Singmaster notation</a> but with "-" for the counter-clockwise rotations.

If there is a problem with the colours you have given, then an error will be indicated in the console.
<br> <br>
‚ö†Ô∏è The cube must remain in the same position as you have defined. ‚ö†Ô∏è

## <span style="color: cornflowerblue"> üéÅ Content
The programm has been tested to work with 1369 different scrambled cases.
<br> <br>
In each case the cube was mixed with a random sequence of movements and the program successfully solved the cube. 
These cases were provided by the tester in about 3 minutes. And are in the test_cases.txt file.

| A graphical user interface made with pygame.| A text-based interface created using pure python. | An infinite loop which tries to solve the cube previously scrambled with a random sequence, if the cube is solved then it tries another one. Useful to debug the program.

## <span style="color: cornflowerblue"> üõ†Ô∏è How does it work 
Home made algorithm for the first two layers and a simplified CFOP, simplified Fridrich method for the last layer.

</div>
 
### First cross
1. **white** center down
   
    a) **red** center in front
        **/** **white-red** edge in the bottom-front position

    b) **green** center in front
        **/** **white-green** edge in the bottom-front position

    c) **orange** center in front
        **/** **white-orange** edge in the bottom-front position

    d) **blue** center in front
        **/** **white-blue** edge in the bottom-front position

### F2L (first two layers)
for each color in (blue, red, green, orange)
1. **blue** center in front

    a) **white-red-blue** corner in the top right position
    
    b) correct corner correctly placed in the bottom right position
    
    c) place correct edge

### Last cross
Solve the last cross according to 4 different cross' states.

### OLL (orient last layer)
Solves the cube according to 7 different cases. (OLL cross)

### PLL (permute last layer)
Solves the pll according to 21 pll cases.

### Rotate last layer
Turns the last layer, the pll sometimes leaves one face to turn.
